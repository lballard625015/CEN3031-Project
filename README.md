WebFit - Fitness Tracking Website

Welcome to WebFit, a web-based application that allows users to track both their calorie intake, macros, and exercise routine. Our software offers a simple workout routine generated automatically for users specifically based on their personal goals. The goal being to make the process of getting started on a personal fitness journey easier and take the stress of knowing where to start out of the equation!

Instructions to Run WebFit Program:

*Ensure you have a working/running mongodb database, install the driver (with npm install mongodb), and insert your connection string (found in "connect") into the backend "index.js" URI slot in line 13.

*To run, begin by downloading all dependencies within the frontend and backend in console.

*Start the backend up by traversing to the backend directory and utilizing "node index.js" to initiate the connection to database.

*Start frontend by traversing to frontend directory and utilizing "npm start" to open website locally.

*To populate database with pre-existing foods if empty, traverse to \backend\test and enter "node foodRun.js".
