//First, read from the csv file and process the results into an array that we can iterate through
csv = csvReader.process(“pathToCSV”)

//Iterate through each row of the csv array and remove workouts that don’t meet the fitness goal
Csv = csvReader.filter(csv, “Fitness Goal”)

//Further filter results based on a user’s fitness level, weight, etc
Csv = csvReader.filter(csv, “Filter”) //Repeat as many times necessary

//Sort the csv array by targeted muscle groups. When we recommend workouts on different dates, the ones on the same dates should target similar muscle groups. Different days, different groups.

//Pull from the final filtered csv array as recommended workouts and post them to the scheduler.




This is to be done after the implementation and testing of the csv reader, which I am currently working on.
For the time being, we can do this manually on the small dataset we are currently using and store it in
the database, stored as workouts for each fitness goal. For example, weight loss will have a set of
workouts and muscle gain will have a set of workouts. There can be overlap etc.
